# Python-Malware-Forensics

## Instructions
Prepare a docker container to process malicious PE files that contain python code.
Given a file, the pipeline should first try to extract python bytecode
(e.g., by using https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) and then
try to decompile the bytecode by using several tools 
(such as https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/
